      When you use Redline Smalltalk you don't loose anything you are used to with the Java ecosystem. You can reuse all your existing Java classes from Redline Smalltalk, make JARs, debug with break points and step line by line through Smalltalk code. The classes you create with Redline are callable from Java, they are proper classes full of bytecode. We are paying special attention to ensuring Redline Smalltalk works with popular toolchains and doesn't present barriers to its use.

    As a Java developer you will need to adjust to typing a lot less and using a more dynamic environment which means a far smaller development cycle with quicker feedback.
