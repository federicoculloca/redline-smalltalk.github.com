So this is the skinny: 

At Smalltalk Solutions earlier this year James and I announced that Jet Brains had agreed in principle to add support for Redline Smalltalk to Intelli-J. Well the time is here, we've met the basic requirements originally discussed with Jet Brains early in 2011 for Redline Smalltalk support to make it onto their roadmap. 

 We need your help to get it moved up the priority chain. Jet Brains has a voting system where registered users vote up features they want to see implemented. As of today, there is now one for Redline support. The next step is pretty simple...

We need everyone to sign up for a Jet Brains account ( or login with your Google or Yahoo account ) and "vote for Redline support.":http://youtrack.jetbrains.net/issue/IDEA-79069

* We need you to tweet about it.
* ... to email people about it.
* ... to google + about it.
* ... to stand on the street corner talking about how the world is going to come to an end unless this happens.

This could end up being a big deal for us and your help is greatly appreciated.
