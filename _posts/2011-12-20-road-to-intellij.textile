So this is the skinny: 

At Smalltalk Solutions earlier this year James and I announced that Jet Brains had agreed in principle to add support for Redline Smalltalk to Intelli-J. Well the time is here, we've met the basic requirements originally discussed with Jet Brains early in 2011 for Redline Smalltalk support to make it onto their roadmap. 

 We need your help to get it moved up the priority chain. Jet Brains has a voting system where registered users vote up features they want to see implemented. As of today, there is now one for Redline support. The next step is pretty simple...

We need everyone to sign up for a Jet Brains account ( or login with your Google or Yahoo account ) and "vote for Redline support.":http://youtrack.jetbrains.net/issue/IDEA-79069

* We need you to tweet about it.
* ... to email people about it.
* ... to google + about it.
* ... to stand on the street corner talking about how the world is going to come to an end unless this happens.

This could end up being a big deal for us and your help is greatly appreciated.

Update: 

This post is currently on the front page of Hacker News and it has been pointed out, that lacking in context, it could be confusing as to why someone into Smalltalk would care about Intelli-J support. Redline Smalltalk is an implementation of Smalltalk that runs on the JVM, designed to work within the JVM ecosystem. For us, that means that it should work with the tooling that JVM developers are familiar with: Eclipse, Intelli-J et al. There is more information elsewhere on the site, but this site is still a work in progress. If you are interested in learning more, right now your best methods are "the mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/redline-smalltalk and our brand new "IRC channel":http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=redline-st.
