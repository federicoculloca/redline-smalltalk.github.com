h2. Introduction

Removing the barriers to using Smalltalk is part of what the Redline project is all about and today another step was taken in that direction. The changes that come with this step are big and impact all of the code that has been written to date but the result is a simpler and easier to use Redline. The way you run Redline has changed to use the java classpath to find your Smalltalk files and the codebase has changed to remove a high percentage of static lists and maps which were making it hard to run Redline in a multi-tenancy or multi-language environment. There is also a new suite of Smalltalk tests to exercise each method of the initial Runtime to give you greater confidence Redline works.
