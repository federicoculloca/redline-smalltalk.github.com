James' ESUG presentation from this August has been posted. Get some popcorn, sit back and "enjoy a magical ride":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX8OeNvgFcs&feature=youtu.be&a through the trial and tribulations of implementating a Smalltalk on the Java Virtual Machine.

Make your movie watching experience even more fun by trying to sync up the video and "the slides":http://www.slideshare.net/esug/smalltalk-on-the-jvm I posted back in September.
