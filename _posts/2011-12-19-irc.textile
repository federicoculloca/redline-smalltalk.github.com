Yesterday afternoon "Steven! Ragnar√∂k" asked on the "mailing list":http://groups.google.com/group/redline-smalltalk/browse_thread/thread/4182d7b1b030bba1 if anyone was interested in setting up an IRC channel for Redline. A few minutes and some ChanServ manipulation later and I had registered #redline-st for our usage.

We're a small community right now so it isn't the most active place but, stop on by so you can say "I was there when...". 

Hope to see you there!

*Server:* irc.freenode.net
