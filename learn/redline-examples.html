    <header><h3>Creating a Class</h3></header>
    <p>
    To create a class in Redline Smalltalk create a file to hold the class definition.
    Convention is a single class definition in a single file, naming the file the same as the class and
    adding a '.st' file extension. 
    For example: the class Customer would be defined in the file Customer.st.
    It is convention to start the name of a class with a capital letter.
    </p>
    <p>
    Below is an example of defining the class Customer using Redline Smalltalk:

{% highlight bash %}
Object < #Customer.
{% endhighlight %}

    In the snippet above the class Object is being sent the message '<' with the argument #Customer.
    The '<' message in Redline is shorthand for the more traditional subclass message 'subclass:instanceVariableNames:classVariableNames:poolDictionaries:category:'.
    You can use the longer form if you wish. For example, the following is equivalent to the statement above:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
Object subclass: #Customer
       instanceVariableNames: ''
       classVariableNames: ''
       poolDictionaries: ''
       category: ''.
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
    In fact the '<' subclass creation message simply sends the longer version.
    The Smalltalk class Class in the file Class.st defines the subclass creation messages.
