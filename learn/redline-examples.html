    <header><h3>Creating a Class</h3></header>
    <p>
    To create a class in Redline Smalltalk use your favourite editor to create a file to hold the class definition. Convention is a single class definition in a single file with the file named the same as the class with a '.st' file extension. For example, the class Customer would be defined in the file Customer.st. It is convention to start the name of a class with a capital letter and therefore the filename as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    Below is an example of defining the Customer class using Redline Smalltalk:

{% highlight bash %}
Object < #Customer.
{% endhighlight %}

    In the snippet above the class Object is being sent the message '<' with the argument #Customer. The '<' message in Redline is shorthand for the more traditional subclass message 'subclass:instanceVariableNames:classVariableNames:poolDictionaries:category:'. You can use the longer form if you wish.
For example, the following is equivalent to the statement above:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
Object subclass: #Customer
       instanceVariableNames: ''
       classVariableNames: ''
       poolDictionaries: ''
       category: ''.
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
    In fact the '<' subclass creation message simply sends the longer version.
    The Smalltalk class Class in the file Class.st defines the subclass creation messages.
