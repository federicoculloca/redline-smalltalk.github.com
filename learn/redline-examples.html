    <header><h3>Creating a Class</h3></header>
    <p>
    To create a class in Redline Smalltalk create a file to hold the class definition.
    Convention is a single class definition in a single file, naming the file the same as the class and
    adding a '.st' file extension. 
    For example: the class Customer would be defined in the file Customer.st.
    It is convention to start the name of a class with a capital letter.
    </p>
    <p>
    Below is an example of defining the class Customer using Redline Smalltalk:

{% highlight smalltalk %}
Object < #Customer.
{% endhighlight %}

    In the snippet above the class Object is being sent the message '<' with the argument #Customer.
    The '<' message in Redline is shorthand for the more traditional subclass message 'subclass:instanceVariableNames:classVariableNames:poolDictionaries:category:'.
    You can use the longer form if you wish. The following is equivalent to the statement above:</p>

{% highlight smalltalk %}
Object subclass: #Customer
       instanceVariableNames: ''
       classVariableNames: ''
       poolDictionaries: ''
       category: ''.
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
    In fact the '<' subclass creation message simply sends the longer version.
    The Smalltalk class Class in the file Class.st defines the subclass creation messages.
    </p>

    <header><h3>Packages</h3></header>
    <p>Redline Smalltalk provides a namespace mechanism known as 'packages'. The implementation of packages in Redline closley follows 
    how packages are defined and used in Java. For more information on Java packages see <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/packages.html">this Lesson</a>.</p>
    <p>
    The key difference between Redline Smalltalk packages and Java packages is that the location of a file in the directory tree
    defines the package in Redline Smalltalk while the 'package' statement defines the package in Java. We prefer the directory tree convention 
    over more typing. For example:
{% highlight bash %}
src/main/smalltalk/com/mydomain/Foo.st
{% endhighlight %}
    The class Foo above is in the package 'com.mydomain'. The Redline compiler lets you define from where in the 
    directory tree packages are to start. In this case src/main/smalltalk.
    </p>
    <p>
    To use a class that is in a different package you need to import it. For example, lets assume the class Customer wants to reference
    the class Address and the class Address is in the package 'traits':
{% highlight smalltalk %}
self import: 'traits.Address'.
{% endhighlight %}
    </p>
    <p>
    Import statements are typically the first statements in a file. You can have multiple 'import' statements, and you can use wildcards
    as well.
{% highlight smalltalk %}
self import: 'traits.Address';
     import: 'parts.*'.
{% endhighlight %}
    </p>
    <p>
    You do not need to import classes you reference that are in the same package as the referring class.
    This is done for you by Redline Smalltalk.
    </p>
    <p>
    Convention is to import each of the classes you reference rather than use the wildcard.
